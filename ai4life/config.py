"""Module to define CONSTANTS used across the AI-model package.

This module is used to define CONSTANTS used across the AI-model package.
Do not misuse this module to define variables that are not CONSTANTS or
exclusive to the ai4life package. You can use the `config.py`
inside `api` to define exclusive CONSTANTS related to your interface.

By convention, the CONSTANTS defined in this module are in UPPER_CASE.
