[![Build Status](https://jenkins.services.ai4os.eu/buildStatus/icon?job=AI4OS%2Fai4os-ai4life-loader%2Fmain)](https://jenkins.services.ai4os.eu/job/AI4OS/job/ai4os-ai4life-loader/job/main/)

The [BioImage Model Zoo](https://bioimage.io/#/) is a community-driven platform that 
  provides standardized deep learning models for bioimage analysis.
  
  This module integrates models from the **BioImage.IO** package into the **AI4EOSC** Marketplace
  dashboard, specifically those using PyTorch weights and following the v0.5 format.
  The module allows users to seamlessly explore, deploy, and utilize these models within 
  the AI4EOSC ecosystem, providing a user-friendly interface for advanced bioimage analysis.
  
**Key Features** 
  - Model Discovery: Automatically fetch and list models available in BioImage.IO that meet the criteria (PyTorch weights, v0.5 format).

  - Metadata Visualization: Display essential information about each model,
   such as input/output specifications, authors, license details, and documentation.

  - Seamless Deployment: Enable one-click deployment of models to AI4EOSC compute resources.

  - Model Preview: Provide an interactive preview to test models on sample data directly in the dashboard.

**Supported Models**
- PyTorch Models: Only models with PyTorch weights are supported to ensure compatibility with our deployment backend.
- BioImage.IO v0.5 Specification: Models must adhere to the v0.5 specification, ensuring a standardized format for inputs, outputs, and metadata.


To launch it, first install the package then run [deepaas](https://github.com/ai4os/DEEPaaS):


> ![warning](https://img.shields.io/badge/Warning-red.svg) **Warning**: If you are using a virtual environment, make sure you are working with the last version of pip before installing the package. Use `pip install --upgrade pip` to upgrade pip.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ai4os/ai4os-ai4life-loader
cd ai4life
pip install -e .
deepaas-run --listen-ip 0.0.0.0
```
