title:  AI4life model loader
summary: "Support for inference of the AI4LIFE model on the marketplace."
description: |-
  The [BioImage Model Zoo](https://bioimage.io/#/) is a community-driven platform that
  provides standardized deep learning models for bioimage analysis.

  This module integrates models from the **BioImage.IO** package into the **AI4EOSC** Marketplace
  dashboard, specifically those using PyTorch weights and following the v0.5 format.
  The module allows users to seamlessly explore, deploy, and utilize these models within
  the AI4EOSC ecosystem, providing a user-friendly interface for advanced bioimage analysis.

  **Key Features**
  - Model Discovery: Automatically fetch and list models available in BioImage.IO that meet the criteria (PyTorch weights, v0.5 format).

  - Metadata Visualization: Display essential information about each model,
   such as input/output specifications, authors, license details, and documentation.

  - Seamless Deployment: Enable one-click deployment of models to AI4EOSC compute resources.

  - Model Preview: Provide an interactive preview to test models on sample data directly in the dashboard.
